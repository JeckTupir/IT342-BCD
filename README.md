**Short Description:**
Hi, I'm Jestopher B. Dela Torre, 22 years old, from San Carlos, Negros Occidental, currently residing in Cebu City, Mambaling. I enjoy playing video games and sports, especially soccer. I'm a chill and approachable guy (though quite short!) and love outdoor activities, though not every day. I'm also a fan of good food. I’m curious and a perfectionist at times.
